#### BreakTheCode from SVAPS Systems(Tech Task) Beer Pack

#### 1. The outcome

That’s right, we begin with the ending.
CHILI Publisher holds a concept called `“folding settings”`. These settings enable users to render a document in 
`3D`, so the end user can see how his/her design folds.

 
Check the video to see how this unfolds (pun intended): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2vSfYykLHY

The folding configuration is stored in an `XML` file. 

The assets folder of this challenge contains the following file: `Beerpack.xml`. 
As soon as this file is loaded in our software, users get an interactive 3D view similar to this:

We don’t expect our users to have any `3D` expertise, we just want them to reap the benefits of ours.

All they have to do is define the rectangular `“panels”` on top of their graphical document. For each panel they 
then have to determine the minimum and maximum rotation angles. 

The `3D` engine in CHILI publisher takes it from there and launches the visual.
Nifty, right?

#### 2. The coding challenge

Nifty requires creative development.
What we would like you to do?
Develop a `C#` application that:
*Parses the supplied `XML file (Beerpack.xml)` and loads it into an object model
*Renders a `2D` representation of the folding scheme.
 
This is what the end result should look like:

#### 3. Tech talk
You’ll need these background essentials before hitting the keyboard. 
When you have opened the supplied `xml` file, you will notice the panels are stored in a tree structure. 
There is always one root panel, and each panel can have child panels. The children of each panel can 
be found in the `“attachedPanels”` child node of each panel.

The position of the root panel is stored in the `“rootX”` and `“rootY”` attributes of the document 
element.


The dimensions of the preview are stored in the `“originalDocumentWidth”` and 
`“originalDocumentHeight”` attributes of the document element. The unit is pixels.

Each panel (except for the root panel) is attached to a specific side of its parent panel. The side index 
is stored in the `“attachedToSide”` attribute of each panel. The scheme below shows which sides 
correspond to the indexes.

Each attached panel is rotated depending on the side it is attached to. With side 0 it’s always 
attached to a side of its parent panel. The coordinate space of the panel is rotated compared to the 
coordinate space of its parent panel:

By default, a child panel is positioned at the center of the parent side. But it is possible it is moved, 
however. This offset is stored in the `“hingeOffset”` attribute of each panel. The unit of this value is 
pixel.


To create the bitmap you can use `System.Drawing.Bitmap`. This class can easily output to a `JPG` file. 
Ready, set, code!
